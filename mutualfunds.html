        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <h3>Mutual Funds are a pool of investment that sells its securities (stocks, bonds, etc..) to investors who have a common goal. </h3>
        <li></li>
        <h2>What are Mutual Funds</h2>
        <h3>Mutual Funds are managed by professional portfolio managers who make decisions about how to allocate the funds’ assets to achieve the fund’s investment objective. Mutual funds allow you to diversify your investments by investing in a pool of investments. Mutual funds can invest in equities, bonds, or other mutual funds.
            Mutual funds fall into three different types including money market funds (mutual fund that invests in short-term fixed income securities.), bonds funds, and equity funds.
            Mutual funds have specific investment objectives, such as growth, income, or preservation of capital.
            </h3>
            <li></li>
            <h2>Guarantee (Risk)</h2>
        <h3>Mutual funds have market risks where the value of the fund’s investments can fluctuate with market conditions, affecting the NAV (Net Asset Value) and the value of investors’ shares. There are also interest rate risks especially relevant for bond funds, as rising interest rates can lead to falling bond prices. Mutual funds each have a different level of risk depending on the fund manager’s investment strategies.
            Money market funds have a low risk, they invest in short-term guaranteed investments such as government bonds and T-Bills (Security where you lend money to the government for a short period of time).
            Bond Funds have a low to medium risk, unlike individual bonds, they don’t have a maturity date (The date where a bond needs to be repaid), so there is no certainty of getting your principle back.
            </h3>
            <li></li>
            <h2>Return</h2>
        <h3>Mutual Funds could pay a regular distribution. If the fund does not you will realize your return only when you sell units back to the fund company. Mutual funds don’t often outperform Indices (Index Funds).</h3>
        <li></li>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>Mutual funds offer diversification and professional management, making them suitable for many investors, especially for long-term goals.</h3>
