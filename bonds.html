        <h1>Bonds</h1>
        <li></li>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <h3>-	Investing in bonds means you are lending money to a company or government. </h3>
        <li></li>
        <h2>What are Bonds</h2>
        <h3>-	A bond Is a loan that will be set for a set period, which is called the term. Over the term of the bond, the bond issuer will usually pay you interest. At the end of a bond’s term or maturity date (the date which a bond is due to be repaid), you should receive the amount of money back that you loaned, plus the interest accumulated on that loan over the term.
            -	For example, if you invest $10,000 in a Canada Saving Bond (Financial product offered by the bank of Canada with a guaranteed minimum amount of interest) with a fixed interest rate of 1%, and a term of 1 year, at the end of the term you can expect to receive back the original investment of $10,00 plus loaned interest if 100$.
            -	Corporate Bonds, A corporate bond is a loan that you make to a company. In return for your loan the issuer will typically pay you interest. Witch the interest rate is typically higher than government bonds. Companies sell Debentures which are like corporate bonds, but the loan is not secure against the company’s assets as collateral of the loan.
            </h3>
            <li></li>
        <h2>Guarantee (Risk)</h2>
        <h3>-	One risk to consider is the rate of inflation that may be higher than the interest rate paid by a bond. Which means if inflation increases more than the interest rate paid back, this causes your investment not to keep up with the cost of living. 
            -	Another Risk to include would be that the company you gave the loan to may not have the resources or money to repay your loan. This causes you to lose some or all the money you invested.
            -	There is a risk of you losing money if you sell a bond before its maturity date and the price of the bond has decreased.
            </h3>
            <li></li>
        <h2>Return</h2>
        <h3>-	In general, the expected gain (rate of return) on a bond investment is related to the amount of risk associated with it. The expected rate of return for bonds is lower than expected for stocks, but bonds tend to be less risky than stocks.</h3>
        <li></li>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>-	Investors tend to use bonds to generate a steady income and to diversify their portfolios. Bonds are generally considered a safer investment than stocks, by they come with their own set of risks as well.</h3>
